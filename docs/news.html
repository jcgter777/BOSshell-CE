<p>So... after a few days of contemplating the logistics of programming BOSshell,
I have realized that I will need some (a lot) of help to complete it.
I currently need help with the software format design, and the interpreter needed to run it.
I am looking for anyone with above-average knowlege of ICE compiler language, and/or experience with designing programming languages,
specifically lower-level languages, or a significant knowlege of how a compiler works, and how to write one.<br>
Any help on this project would be greatly appreciated! :)</p>
<p>(please PM me at Cemetech if you are interested)<br>
P.S. You do not need to be a registered developer to help develop this project, but you will be afterwards! :)<br>
